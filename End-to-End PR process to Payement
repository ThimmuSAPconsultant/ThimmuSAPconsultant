**PROCURE-TO-PAY(P2P):**

Procurement is nothing but Every organization is acquires Materials or Services complete it business needs.The process of byying material obtainign services is called  as a Procurement!.
procurement is shoud be done in such away Materials are Order in a correct quantity, with proper value at the time. it is divided into two parts.
**1)Procure-To-Pay:**
**2)Special Procurment**

**Procure-To-Pay**

1) determination of requirement
2) Source Determination
3) Vendor Selection
4) Purchase order Processing
5) Purchase order Monitoring
6) Goods Receipts
7) Invoice Verification
8) Payment Process

   **1) Determination of requirement:**
              Materila requirment are identified either in the user Department (or) via Material Planning and controling
   
                ** SAP Process**
                        Creating the Material master, Vendor Master, PIR, PR.
   **2) Source Detemination**
          The Purchasing Component "help you identify potential sources of supply based on past order and existing long-terms purchase agreement agreement.

               **SAP Process**
                     Vendor master, Source List, RFQ, PO.
   
   **3) Vendor Selection **
             This is cable of simmulating pricing Scenarios, allowing you to compare a number of differen quataation.

              **SAP Process**
                   Creating the RFQ.
  ** 4)Purchase order Processing**
        The Purchase Order Adopted information from reqisition  and Quotation to help you create a Purchase Order
        
         **SAP Process**
                Create the PO.

    **5) Purchase Order Monitoring**
         The follow-up  can be carried out with Vendors  forthe  Expending the Purchase Order.
         
             **SAP Process**
              Material --> ME2N
              Supplyer --> ME2L

    **6) Goods Receipts**
          Goods Receving Personal can be conform  the Receipt of goods simple  by Entering the PO number. By Specifing Permisible  tolerances, Buyers can Limit over-end under deliverries order goods At this time we can have quality check for the mateerial
 
             **SAP Process**
              Create Goods Receiving --> MIGO

      **7) Invoice Verification**
          The system supplier the checking and Matching of Invoices account Payable department notified of Quantity and Price Variance Because the System has access to PO and Goods Receipt data. this speeds the Process of auditing and entering invoice for Payment.
          
          **SAP Process**
           Create Invoice Verification --> MIRO

     ** 8) Payment Process **
        Payment  are prcessed from Account Payable in FI




2) Special Procurement
    Special Procurement in SAP MM (Materials Management) refers to specific procurement processes that differ from standard purchasing. These processes involve sourcing materials under special circumstances or from specific locations (such as stock transfers between plants, consignment stock, or subcontracting). These strategies are typically u

Types Of Procurement:

    1)Subcontracting Purchase Order- Item category L
    2)Consignment Purchase Order- Item category K
    3)Stock Transfer Purchase Order- Item category U
    4)Service Purchase Order- Item category D
    5)Standard Purchase Order- Item category Blank

1)Subcontracting:
   In subcontracting we provide a raw material to subcontractor vendor, he processes the material and he returns back to our company as a semifinished material or finished material . we are paying charges to subcontractor vendor.
Example: We have one starter motor manufacturing company who manufactures the starter motors company provides the raw materials like starter housing, armature, bushes, solenoid and pinion bendex to subcontractor vendor. Subcontractor vendor processes and assembles the all components and fianally returns the Starter motor to our company. 

Subcontracting process with over consumption & under consumption
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We supply raw material to subcontractor vendor what if he consumes
 --> More quantity than supplied is called over consumption 
 --> Less quantity than supplied is called under consumption

Example for over consumption:
  When you create a subcontracting PO for 100 finished Materials as per BOM we have to supply child materials. Because of some child parts got damaged & vendor comes to you and asks for more raw material this is called as over consumption.

Example for under consumption:
  When you create a subcontracting PO for 100finished materials per BOM we have to supply child materials. Some child parts vendor consumes less this is called as Under consumption


Subcontracting process with Over consumpions:
----------------------------------------------

1)Create materials raw material and finished materials
   Ex: Finished Mat --> starter motor, Raw Mat --> starter housing, armature, bushes, solenoid & pinion bendex.
2)Create Sub contracting vendor
3)Create Sub contracting PIR
4)Create Bill of Material(BOM)
5)Create PO with item category L
6)Post goods issue
7)transfer Posting for over consumed child  part
8)Goods receipt for finished material
9)Subsequent adjustment for over consumed materials



Subcontracting with under consumption
When you create a subcontracting PO for 100 finished materials as per BOM we have to supply child materials. Some child parts vendor consumes less this scenario is called as under consumption
EX: Let’s take our starter motor example in this process vendor asked 100kgs of copper wire for solenoid manufacturing for 100 starter motors but vendor consumed only 90kgs of copper 10kgs of copper has under consumed by vendor.

Steps Involved in subcontracting process under consumption:
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Create materials raw materials and finished materials T code: MM01
Ex: Finished material starter motor,
Raw materials starter housing, armature, bushes, solenoid ,pinion bendex & copper wire
2. Create Sub contracting vendor T code: XK01
3. Create sub contracting PIR T code : ME11
4. Create Bill of material ( BOM) T code: CS01
5. Create Purchase Order (PO) with item category L T code: ME21N
6. Post goods issue T code : ME2O
7. Goods receipt for finished material T code : MIGO
8. Subsequent adjustment for under consumed materials T code: MIGO
9. Transfer posting of under consumed raw material from vendor T code: MIGO
Stock to unrestricted


2)Consignment Purchase Order:
-----------------------------
In the consignment process, say material is send by the vendor and it is kept at company premises here ownership of this material is lies with the vendor For example usually we raise the purchase requisition of 100 quantities and do the purchase order of 100 quantities and receive the goods receipt for these 100 quantities here ownership lies with you then you do invoice posting In consignment process, once you received the goods receipt you don’t pay the vendor for received 100 quantities because ownership is lies with vendor Going forward either you consume it or transfer ownership from vendor to yours. Depends on the quantity you received/consume accordingly you pay to vendor after settlement with vendor, here ownership lies with you once you pay to the vendor depends on how much quantity you consumed.
Steps involved in consignment process:
1. Create consignment purchase info records (TCODE: ME11)
2. Create consignment Purchase order with item category K (TCODE: ME21N)
3. Create Goods Receipt (TCODE:MIGO)
No accounting entries (special stock) here though goods received still ownership lies with
vendor and material is shown in vendor consignment not in storage location
The stock which is present in vendor consignment is knows as special stock
4. Based on material consumption or transfer to own stock using TCODE:MIGO
Either you consume some quantity from special stock or transfer ownership of whole
stock from vendor to yours

Accounting entries:
Consignment G/L account credit (-)-KON
Stock account debit (+)-BSX
Here in both cases ownership lies with you as you consumed so accounting entries generated

5. Create condition records (TCODE:MRM1) with output type KONS
6. Settlement (TCODE:MRKO)

Accounting entries:
Vendor account credit (-)-KBS
Consignment G/L account debit (+)-KBS
Depends on how many quantities consumed you do settlement with vendor
